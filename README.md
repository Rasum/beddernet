# Beddernet

Beddernet for Android, mobile ad-hoc middleware based on the Beddernet protocol.

Beddernet runs as a service and allows applications to easily communicate with a large number of devices using a simple API.

Beddernet can be applied in highly volatile environments as it uses a simple but robust mesh algorithm that has self-healing and organizing capabilities.
